# Diabetes-Prediction
##### Problem Statement
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

### Overview of Project

**D**iabetes **M**ellitus (DM), commonly referred to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Type 1 diabetes results from the pancreas's failure to produce enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly. As of 2015, an estimated 415 million people had diabetes worldwide, with type 2 diabetes making up about 90% of the cases. This represents 8.3% of the adult population. 

The [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) can be used to train machine learning models to predict if a given patient has diabetes. This dataset contains measurements relating to Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and Age.

### About the Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
