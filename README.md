# Diabetes-Prediction
##### Problem Statement
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

### Overview of Project

**D**iabetes **M**ellitus (DM), commonly referred to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Type 1 diabetes results from the pancreas's failure to produce enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly. As of 2015, an estimated 415 million people had diabetes worldwide, with type 2 diabetes making up about 90% of the cases. This represents 8.3% of the adult population.
